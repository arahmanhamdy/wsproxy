cd caddman
./caddyman.sh install wsproxy
```

## Plugin Usage
In your caddy file use the `wsproxy` directive:

`wsproxy [PATH] TCP_SOCKET_ADDRESS`

where: 

`PATH` is the server path which will start websocket connection, if ommited it will match `/`

`TCP_SOCKET_ADDRESS` is the tcp socket address needs to connect to.

Example:
```
http://localhost:8200 {
    wsproxy     /redis      localhost:6379
}
```
